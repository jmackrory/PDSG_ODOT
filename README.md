# Portland Data Science Group "Applied Data Science"
# July 2018: Oregon Dept of Transportation Crash Data

This month the PDSG is working with ODOT Crash Data System data gathered from zigzag.odot.state.or.us by Seth Urbach.
The initial data set covered 2012-2015, with the plan being to predict something about 2016.
The data contains around 150 columns detailing participants,
causes, roadway type, location, time/date, impairment, etc.
Full details on each column are in the CDS code manual.

I was working towards finding where the most dangerous streets for riding a biycle are. 
This mostly been focused on just plotting a heatmap of the accidents for all years, which 
produces some striking images of Portland's road network.

In the interests of actual analysis I will do some simple statistics: number of accidents
by month, accidents by time of day, fraction of accidents with impairment (Perhaps Marijuana after 2014).
